The minute he walked in the door I knew it was over.

"So your other interviews were easy eh?" he said. "We'll see about
this one. How many bits do you need to represent a number up to 56
million?"

This was an interview for a graduate position, and I'd just finished
my PhD in computational linguistics.

"Log base 2 of 56 million," I replied.

"Which is?" he said.

"Give me a calculator and I'll tell you," I replied. He'd brought
along a trainee interviewer and I could tell he was showing off. I
felt like he really wanted to make me feel small. And I did. My heart
started to pound and I knew I wouldn't be able to focus. I think best
when I'm relaxed, on my own, maybe going for a walk.

"You don't need a calculator," he said. By this point I had completely
frozen, I felt useless. I knew I was going to fail the interview.

"What powers of two do you know?" he asked.

"256 is 2 to the power of 8," I replied. When I was growing up, 256
colours on your screen was a _lot_.

"What else?" he replied. "You should know some important powers
of 2. What's 2 to the power of 10?" I managed to figure out that
it's 1024.

"So now answer the question," he said. For the life of me, I had no
idea what he wanted me to do.

"Ok, so what's 2 to the power of 20?"

"Well I guess it's 1024 times 1024?"

"Correct. Which is roughly?"

"A million?"

"Exactly. So now can you answer the question?"

"Well I guess if 20 bits gives you a million, then you need a few more
to get 56, well 6 would be enough. So 26 bits?"

"You see, you didn't need a calculator!"

He continued to ask more questions about numbers of bits. I couldn't
answer any of them without a lot of help. He didn't ask me about my
PhD work building a new theory of natural language semantics.

"So three of the interviewers gave really positive feedback," said the
recruiter a few weeks later. "One of them was not positive I'm afraid,
and that means we can't hire you."

"I know which one that was," I said. I was devastated.

That was 15 years ago. At the time "Don't be evil" still meant
something. Now it seems like their mantra is just "Be evil". At first
it was just that they [pretended that their ads were search
results](https://darkpatterns.uxp2.com/pattern/google-ads-disguised-as-search-results/). But now they [are avoiding paying taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google#Tax_evasion), [ignoring privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google#Privacy),
[supporting genocide, and firing anyone that protests](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/18/google-fires-staff-protest-israel-contract).

Three years ago I decided I'd had enough. I wanted to build a search
engine that would be the "anti-Google". Instead of being driven by
profit, it's non-profit, and driven by our community. It's you who
[chooses what sites we crawl](https://mwmbl.org/app/domain-submissions/), you who [ranks the search results](https://book.mwmbl.org/page/curating/), and you
who [fund us through donations](https://opencollective.com/mwmbl). It's you who crawls the web, using our
[command line script](https://github.com/mwmbl/crawler-script) or [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/mwmbl-web-crawler/).

We're a long way off building something that's as good as Google. It's
going to take years. But I believe if we all work together, we can
build something much better.

The [code is open source](https://github.com/mwmbl) and anyone can contribute. We're not
conducting any interviews.
