The mumble team took a bit of a great since August to work on some other areas of life, but we have been quietly planning the last several months around a couple of areas:
 - **Editing search results**
    - The most requested feature is to be able to suggest sites to crawl. We're planning to go one better and let users edit the whole search results ranking _and_ add their own search results.

 - **Promotion**
    -  We are working on a YouTube channel to share some of the technology ideas that we have as a team to make an impact on free search

 - **Funding**
    - We have been focused on researching open funding through grants along with trying to make sure we have the right structure/ideas around this area so we would not later impact the non-profit we plan on standing up.

 - **Leadership**
    - We are still gathering leadership members to help build this fantastic open-source search product. 

 - **UI/UX Engineering**
    - We are looking for UI/UX Engineering staff to help continue to build out the look/feel of the website.


**Are you interested in helping the project?**

Come chat, give us feedback, and share any ideas you might have to help the project on our [Matrix server](https://matrix.to/#/#mwmbl:matrix.org).

Help us index web pages by [installing our Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/mwmbl-web-crawler/) to crawl the web. Our ranking evaluations have shown that the biggest improvements come from indexing more pages. So that is our first priority.

Help us raise enough money to form an official non-profit organisation. This will be the first step in making Mwmbl sustainable, beyond being a side-project for a few people.
Get to £50 monthly recurring revenue to enable us to upgrade our server (currently costing under €5 a month) - [donate here](https://opencollective.com/mwmbl)! This will allow us to increase the size of our index, improving our search results.

Check out some of our open positions as [we’re recruiting volunteers](https://github.com/mwmbl/mwmbl/wiki/Open-positions), or if you’re a developer, [check out the open issues](https://github.com/mwmbl/mwmbl/issues).

Thank you so much to all those that have helped out so far, whether by donating your CPU and bandwidth to crawl the web, giving money to cover our costs, giving your time and skills to fix issues or giving feedback on our [Matrix server](https://matrix.to/#/#mwmbl:matrix.org).
