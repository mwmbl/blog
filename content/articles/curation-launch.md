We recently launched the new version of [Mwmbl](https://mwmbl.org)
which includes the long-awaited feature of allowing users to curate
search results. This is an experiment, since we don't know:

 - Will people want to curate search results?
 - How will we determine what is an objectively good search ranking?
 - How will we deal with and prevent spam?
 - How will we build and manage the community?
 - Can we use curated search results as training for
   [learning to rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank)?
 - Will this be better than the heuristics used by the big search engines?

and probably a lot more important things I haven't thought of. But
this is why it is exciting! If we knew everything already, it would be
boring.

Early indications are that at least a small proportion of people are
happy to give curation a go, and we're already seeing a bit of
self-promotion, which is fine, for now. We'll deal with it if and when
it becomes a problem.

If this experiment works, it will be a watershed moment for web
search. Search rankings will be in the hands of the community and not
the big companies. And that is our
[mission](https://book.mwmbl.org/#mission).
